**Flexoki** is an inky color scheme for prose and code, designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog inks and warm shades of paper.

This extension provides both light and dark variants:

- **Flexoki Light** — warm paper tones with rich accent colors
- **Flexoki Dark** — deep ink black with softer accent colors

The palette uses carefully chosen colors that are easy on the eyes while maintaining excellent readability and contrast.
